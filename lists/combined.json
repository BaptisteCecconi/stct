Z axis is parallel to the geomagnetic\n      dipole axis, positive north. X is in the plane defined by the Z axis\n      and the Earth's rotation axis. If N is a unit vector from the Earth's\n      center to the north geographic pole, the signs of the X and Y axes are\n      given by Y = N x Z, X = Y x Z.. See Russell, 1971\n      \n\n      The implementation of this frame is complicated in that the definition\n      of the IGRF dipole is a function of time and the IGRF model cannot be\n      directly incorporated into Spice. However, Spice does allow one to define\n      time dependent Euler angles. Meaning, you can define an Euler angle\n      that rotates GEO to MAG for a given ephemeris time t:\n\n         V           = r(t) * V\n          GEI                  MAG\n      \n      where r(t) is a time dependent Euler angle representation of a\n      rotation. Spice allows for the time dependence to be represented by a\n      polynomial expansion. This expansion can be fit using the IGRF model,\n      thus representing the IGRF dipole axis.\n\n      IGRF-11 (the 11th version) was fit for the period of 1990-2020, which\n      should encompass the mission and will also make this kernel useful for\n      performing Magnetic dipole frame transformations for the 1990's and\n      the 2000's. However, IGRF-11 is not as accurate for this entire time\n      interval. The years between 1945-2005 are labeled definitive, although\n      only back to 1990 was used in the polynomial fit. 2005-2010 is\n      provisional, and may change with IGRF-12. 2010-2015 was only a\n      prediction. Beyond 2015, the predict is so far in the future as to not\n      be valid. So to make the polynomials behave nicely in this region (in\n      case someone does try to use this frame during that time), the\n      2015 prediction was extended until 2020. So for low precision, this\n      kernel can be used for the years 2015-2020. Any times less than 1990\n      and greater than 2020 were not used in the fit, and therefore may be\n      vastly incorrect as the polynomials may diverge outside of this region.\n      These coefficients will be refit when IGRF-12 is released.\n      \n      Also, since the rest of the magnetic dipole frames are defined from\n      this one, similar time ranges should be used for those frames.\n\n                  Definitive           Provisional   Predict    Not Valid\n       |------------------------------|+++++++++++|###########|???????????|\n     1990                           2005        2010        2015        2020\n\n      In addition to the error inherit in the model itself, the polynomial\n      expansion cannot perfectly be fit the IGRF dipole. The maximum error\n      on the fit is .2 milliradians, or .01 degrees. \n\n      The MAG frame is achieved by first rotating the GEO frame about Z by\n      the longitude degrees, and then rotating about the Y axis by the\n      amount of latitude.
